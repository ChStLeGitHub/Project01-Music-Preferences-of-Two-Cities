# Music Preferences of Two Cities
 
**Objective:** To analyze and compare the music preferences and user behavior of the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville using Yandex Music data. 

**Accomplishments:** Regarding Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Springfield residents as a whole listen to significantly more songs on Mondays and Fridays than on Wednesdays; in contrast, Shelbyville residents are the other way around. Additionally, I found that the two cities have the same top 5 most listened to genres: (in descending order) pop, dance, rock, electronic, and hip hop. Lastly, the top 15 most listened to genres are virtually the same in both cities no matter if it is Monday morning or Friday evening.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Data evaluation, data preprocessing, comparative analysis, and consumer insight generation
